### Day 8 - Operators in Python

In Day 8, we dive into the core topic of Operators in Pythonâ€”essential tools for performing various operations on data. This guide covers:

What are Operators?
Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values, forming the backbone of programming logic.

Types of Operators in Python:

Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
Comparison Operators: Compare two values to return a boolean result.
Logical Operators: Combine conditional statements to return True or False.
Bitwise Operators: Operate at the bit level, useful for low-level tasks.
Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables with or without performing additional operations.
Membership Operators: Test if a value is part of a sequence, like a list or string.
Identity Operators: Compare the memory locations of two objects.
Ternary Operators: Perform conditional assignments in a single line.
